# RT Implementation Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: BitBake Parse Error - Trailing Spaces
**Error**: `ParseError at linux-raspberrypi_6.6.bbappend:13: unparsed line`

**Cause**: BitBake doesn't allow trailing spaces after variable assignments or inline comments on assignment lines.

**Original**:
```conf
RT_PATCH_MINOR ?= "32"  # Update this to match available RT patch version
```

**Fixed**:
```conf
# Update RT_PATCH_MINOR and RT_PATCH_NUM to match available RT patch version
RT_PATCH_MINOR ?= "32"
```

### Issue 2: Old BitBake Override Syntax
**Error**: `Variable do_unpack_append contains an operation using the old override syntax`

**Cause**: Using deprecated `_append` syntax instead of new `:append` syntax with colon.

**Original**:
```python
do_unpack_append() {
```

**Fixed**:
```python
do_unpack:append() {
```

## What Was Changed

1. ✓ Removed trailing spaces from variable assignments
2. ✓ Moved comments to separate lines above variables
3. ✓ Changed `do_unpack_append()` to `do_unpack:append()`
4. ✓ Verified build configuration parses correctly

## Build Status

✅ **Parse successful** - No errors
✅ **Clean successful** - Kernel build cleaned
⏳ **Ready to build** - Ready for `bitbake core-image-minimal`

## Next Steps

Build the image:
```bash
cd /mnt/build-storage/yacto_rpi5
source poky/oe-init-build-env build
bitbake core-image-minimal
```

The RT patches will be automatically downloaded and applied if `MACHINE_FEATURES += "preempt-rt"` is enabled.
